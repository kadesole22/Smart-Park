This program utilizes a hashtable class that ive built. The program works to help manage parking. Utilizing my hashtable class and an array of queues we are able to help manage parking lots. In this specific program if the parking lot already contains 4 cars
then its considered full and we remove an element before we can add a new object to the lot. However, this class is flexible and its functionality can be adjusted depending on the consumers needs. Along with this, there is functionality to do advanced functionality like update profiles, insert, remove, retrieve, make empty and a variety of other functions that are designed to give the clientele more flexibility when they are working inside the hashtable. This program will work best when the the distribution of vehicles in the lot is relatively even. If not, using another program may be more efficient.
