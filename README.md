This program utilizes a hashtable class that ive built. The program works to help manage parking. Utilizing my hashtable and an array of queues we are able to help manage parking lots. In this specific program if the parking lot already contains 4 cars
then its considered full and we must remove an element before we can add a new object to the lot. Along with this, there is functionality to do cool things like update profiles, insert, remove, retrieve, make empty and a variety of other functions that
are designed to give the clientele more flexibility when they are working inside the hashtable. This program will work best when the the distribution of vehicles in the lot is relatively even. If not, using another program may be more efficient.
